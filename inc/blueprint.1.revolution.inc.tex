% the digital revolution remains marginal in the field of decision-making, and is almost completely absent of our political institutions [MARGOT-DUCLOT~2015]
% trust in our political systems require more frequent votes, votes that have greater impact, votes that are not made out of paper [MARGOT-DUCLOT~2015]
% because voting is at the roots of democratic societies, e-voting should be flawless [MARGOT-DUCLOT~2015]
% users don't only chose who or what they vote for, they chose how they will do it [MARGOT-DUCLOT~2015]

Distributed ledgers have the potential to disrupt the way society works. Not only the banking or the financial technology sector is affected by this new technology called \textit{blockchain} but almost everything from the internet of decenthings to distributed governance.\par
Regarding the focus of this paper, blockchain has the potential to revolutionize voting, direct and liquid democracy approaches. The idea is to decentralize democratic processes, promote election fairness and online voting security [VARSHNEYA~et~al.~2015].\par
Known electronic voting systems are usually proprietary and centralized, e.g., a single entity controls everything: the hardware, the code base, the data base, system outputs and even the monitoring tools [NOIZAT~2014]. Adam Kaleb Ernest of the \textsc{Follow My Vote} project describes the electronic voting process in the United States as \textit{black box voting} and links the lack of transparency directly to lower voter turnouts [ERNEST~2014]. In addition, the used systems have been vulnerable for software and hardware attacks for a long time. Sufficient alternatives still have to be developed [VARSHNEYA~et~al.~2015].\par
It's about time to talk about 21st centurary approaches to voting: technology which will be decentralized and legislation which will be distributed to pave the way for a modern society [ROCKWELL~2014].
